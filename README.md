# JSBeatDetector
Beat detector JavaScript algorithm using Web Audio API.

If you're interested into animate your applications with some hearthbeat alike animation,
here I created a script which allows you to scale up and down HTML elements 
at the beat of your audio files. And you can totally customize it!

All of this was done with vanilla JavaScript and Web Audio API.
